A more sophisticated variation of fraudulent giveaways and sponsorships occurs when hackers already possess some of your information but require additional details to successfully breach your account. Instead of providing a link to a bogus login page, hackers may request that you complete a survey asking for personal information such as your birthdate, mother's maiden name, and other commonly used security question answers.

Check out this real-life example of a phishing email that resulted in @FlipFlopWanderers getting their account compromised. You can read more about their experience and how it happened by following the link.

The answer.

Do not hurry or experience any form of coercion to click on links. It is important to thoroughly examine the email to determine its authenticity. This can be done by checking for any spelling errors and hovering over the hyperlink to verify if it directs to a familiar and secure website. For an added layer of security, you may also consider searching for the company mentioned in the email on Google and reaching out to them to confirm if they indeed sent you the email.

5. Fake social media platforms.

The strategy.

Maintaining a strong social media presence can be a time-consuming task, especially when dealing with a large and engaged following. While there are numerous tools available to streamline the process, it's essential to carefully assess each platform to ensure it's developed by a trustworthy source. Similarly to malicious web extensions, cybercriminals can create fake tools that claim to enhance functionality but actually pose a threat to your online security.

These tools may appear legitimate, but they offer little to no practical use or functionality. This type of scheme is not as widespread since it requires a significant amount of resources, but it's still employed by cybercriminals who target high-value victims.

When successful, users may integrate the fake tool into their social media accounts, which can be used to launch man-in-the-middle attacks, intercept data, extract login credentials, and more.

The answer.

Monitoring your expenses is a common practice, particularly when starting out on Instagram. However, using inexpensive tools from lesser-known sources may make you more susceptible to scams. To prevent this, it is advisable to choose reputable tools from well-known providers or platforms that have received positive recommendations from trusted individuals.

6. Incidents of reverse proxy hacking.

The strategy.

In contrast to the social engineering techniques discussed previously, which involve creating fake apps or websites to gather information from targets, reverse proxy attacks enable hackers to automatically steal credentials without the need for manual creation of spoofed web pages or applications.

A reverse proxy attack involves hackers using a man-in-the-middle strategy, where they lead victims to a domain that positions itself between the user and the legitimate website. The URL of this domain will closely resemble the legitimate page, and the malicious domain's general appearance mimics that of the legitimate page.

You might receive an email that appears to be from Instagram, prompting you to log in to your account. However, the link in the email actually takes you to a fake login page designed by a hacker. Unbeknownst to you, your login credentials and two-factor authentication information are being captured in real-time by the hacker through a proxy server.

The answer or resolution to the problem or challenge at hand.

Exercise extreme caution when selecting links within your email inbox. Always ensure the legitimacy of an email purportedly sent by Instagram by cross-checking with your Instagram account. Within your profile, navigate to Security >> Emails. If the email does not appear in that section, it is probable that it is a fraudulent attempt.

After gaining unauthorized access to your account, what actions do hackers typically take?

Now that we've explored the methods used by hackers to compromise Instagram accounts, let's discuss the motivations behind these attacks. Understanding why cybercriminals might target your profile can help you take preventive measures to protect your online presence.

Similar to other categories of offenders, hackers and other malevolent individuals gravitate towards widely used platforms due to the substantial financial prospects they offer. Presently, an extensive follower base can result in a considerable income, which is exactly what hackers strive to exploit for their own gain.

After a hacker gains unauthorized access to your account, they may attempt to exploit the situation in various ways, such as:

Requesting a ransom payment in exchange for restoring access to your data.

⦁ Deceive and defraud individuals close to you, including acquaintances, relatives, and clientele. Among the frequently occurring scams are those related to investments, Bitcoin, and romantic relationships.

⦁ Vend your account on the hidden corners of the internet.

⦁ Exploit your account for carrying out deceitful activities.

⦁ Generate illicit demands of different kinds, such as soliciting explicit photographs.

⦁ Steps to Take in the Event of Your Instagram Account Being Compromised.

If you're a business owner who has been hacked on Instagram, it can be a stressful and detrimental experience, especially if you rely on your account to promote your services and generate sales. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to address the issue. Check out the video below for a detailed explanation of the steps you can take to recover your account and secure it from future hacks.
